# PunyPaint

PunyPaint started life as a flood fill algorithm written for the command line. It's gradually developed into a flood fill implementation using SDL in which you can also draw lines and select colors - a kind of miniature paint program. PunyPaint has a long way to go before it's going to displace real paint programs, but it's a great sandbox for graphical display and interaction using C++ and SDL.

Looking to get started with SDL2? I highly recommend [Lazy Foo's tutorials](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php), which got (and continue to get) me off the ground, as well as the [SDL2 Wiki](https://wiki.libsdl.org/).
